*Ministry of Testing* started a [#30DaysOfTesting](http://www.ministryoftesting.com/2016/06/30-day-testing-challenge/) challenge for the July. I decided to join the challenge as it provides a great opportunity to have some fun, learn new skills and share it with the testing community.

Here is a summary of what I did during the last 30 days.

***NOTE:** Due to summer holidays and other schedules I did cheat a bit regarding the rules of the challenge. Not all challenges were achieved on the given day of the challenge as few challenges was needed to be rescheduled for more suitable days.*

###1 Buy one testing related book and read it by day 30

Decided to read [Agile Testing: A Practical Guide for Testers and Agile Teams](https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Testing-Practical-Guide-Testers/dp/0321534468) by Janet Grecory and Lisa Crispin. I had it already in my bookself waiting to be read, and #30DaysOfTesting gave the needed motivation push for it.

###2 Take a photo of something you are doing at work

The 2nd day was Saturday, so no work on that day. But read some chapter's on Agile Testing book. Here's a pic.

###3 Listen to a testing podcast

Listened a Joe Colantonio's #TestTalks podcast [Appium for Beginners with James Koch](https://joecolantonio.com/testtalks/107-appium-beginners-james-koch/).  

###4 Share a testing blog post with a non-tester

Tbd.

###5 Read and comment on one blog post

Tbd.

###6 Perform a crazy test

###9 Create a mindmap

###10 Find an event to attend (online or face to face)

Did not find any suitable testing related events for the 10th day. However, I participated earlier (5th of July) in Ministry of Testing online masterclass [How To Build A Regression Checking Strategy with Mark Winteringham](http://www.ministryoftesting.com/training-events/).

###11 Take a picture of your team

Tbd.

###12 Doodle a problem

Tbd.

###13 Find a user experience problem

The [Microsoft OneDrive](http://onedrive.live.com) login process seems to make absolutely no sense. To access your OneDrive account, you need to go through four (4) login pages:

On the [1st page]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/2016-07-31/onedrive1.png) you select to sign-in. Next, on the [2nd page]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/2016-07-31/onedrive2.png) you enter you email address. Then, on the [3rd page]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/2016-07-31/onedrive3.png) you select either personal or business account. And finally, on the [4th page]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/2016-07-31/onedrive4.png) you *re-enter* your email address and password for OneDrive login.

As a user I would appreciate a faster way to access my OneDrive content via browser.
