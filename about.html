<ul>
    <li>Banking sector and on-line banking</li>
    <li>Real-time information systems for Public Transportation</li>

<p>Currently I am working in private sector on product development projects, but I have also many years of experience from public-funded Tekes and Eureka/EU research projects.</p>

<p>I maintain this blog as a hobby to write about interesting topics (mainly) related to software testing, development and test automation. Occasionally the blog may also cover other topics related to my hobbies and life.</p>
